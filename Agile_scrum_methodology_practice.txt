                              AGILE  METHODOLOGY
                     ------------------------------	  
							  
DEFINATION :
-----------------
Agile follows Iterative(repeating the process) and incremental(we keep on adding the new features) approach.
Agile is Iterative and incremental process.

PRINCIPLES :
------------------
Customer no need to wait for longer time.
We develop, test and release piece of software to the customer with few number of features.
We can accept requirement changes from the customer at any stage of development.
There will be good communication between Customer, Business Analyst, Developers and Testers.


ADVANTAGES:
-----------------
Delivery is very fast in agile process (within two to three weeks we deliver piece of software).
good communication between team.
It is very easy to adopt.

DISADVANTAGES:-
------------------------
Less focus on design and Documentation since we deliver software very fast. 


SCRUM :
--------------------
Scrum is framework through which we build a software product by following Agile Principles.
In scrum group of people are involved called SCRUM Team, Normally there are 5-9 members.
there are 4 type of people involved
1) Product Owner.
2) Scrum Master.
3) Dev Team
4) QA Team.

1) Product Owner:
-------------------
   Product Owner always contact to customer. take requirements from customer.
   Define the feature of the product.
   Prioritize features according to market value.
   Adjust features and priorities in every iteration, as needed
   Accept or reject work result.
   
2) Scrum Master:
--------------------
   The main role is Facilitating and driving the agile process.
   
3) Dev and QA:
--------------------
   developing and testing the software.
   
Scrum Terminology:
-----------------------------
Product owner will define the features in the form of User stories and Epic.

User Story          : A feature/Module in Software.
Epic                : Collection of User stories, epic is large requirement, prepared by product owner.
Product Backlog     : Contains list of user stories. Prepared by product owner.

Sprint/Iteration    : Period of time to complete user stories, decided by the product owner and team, 
                      usually 2-4 weeks of time.
					  
Sprint Planning     : Meeting conduct with the team to decide what can be delivered in the sprint and duration.
Meeting           
Sprint Backlog      : List of committed stories by Dev/QA for specific sprint.

Scrum Meeting       : Meeting conducted by scrum master everyday 15 min. Called as scrum call/Standup meeting.
                      what did you done yesterday?
                      what you will do today?
                      Are there any problems/blocker in your task?
					  
Sprint Retrospective: Conducts meeting after completion of sprint. The entire team, including both the Scrum master
Meeting               and product owner should participate.	

Story point         : Rough estimation of user stories, will be given by Dev/QA in the form of 
                      Fibonacci series.
					  1 story point = 1 hour/ 1 day
					 
Burndown chart      : Shows how much work remaining in the sprint. Maintained by the scrum master daily. 	


Roles:
----------
1) Product Owner
2) Scrum Master
3) team				  

Artefacts:
----------
1) Product Backlog
2) Sprint Backlog
3) Burndown Chart

SCRUM BOARD:
-------------
Scrum board is maintain by the team. 
this the table which contains columns like, Stories, To do , In Progress, Testing, Done(completed stories).
It contains the data like  
   how many stories are planned, 
   how many to do stories,
   how many are in progress,
   how many completed testing,
   how many are completed, and ready to deliver.
   
Each activity track using a tool called "Agile management tool", e.g. Jira

Definition of Ready(DoR):
----------------------------------

User story must be clear, it is testable, feasible, clearly defined, every story has some acceptance criteria
if these parameters are clearly defined then we can say story is ready. This is known as Definition of Ready.

Definition of Done(DoD):
----------------------------------
Developer will designing the story, development, unittesting, integration testing, testcases created,
testing is done, sanity , regression everything is fixed, bugs are fixed, there is no bug ,ready for demo 
and demo is also completed then we can say ,story is completed.it satisfies all the parameters of 
Definition of Done.
